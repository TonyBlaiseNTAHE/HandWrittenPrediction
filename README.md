# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## Overview

The "Handwritten Digit Recognition" is a simple yet effective tool for recognizing handwritten digits. This project is powered by a machine learning model originally trained with PyTorch, and the outputs have been adapted to JavaScript format for use in the browser. The application utilizes arrays and matrices to represent biases and weights, allowing for quick and efficient digit recognition.

## How It Works

The core of the "Handwritten Digit Recognition" is a neural network, which is a computational model inspired by the human brain. It consists of layers of interconnected nodes or "neurons" that process input data, learn from it, and make predictions. In this case, the model predicts handwritten digits from 0 to 9 using learned weights and biases from the training phase.
